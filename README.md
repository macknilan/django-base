Project in Django that serves as the base (template) to start a project.

-   [x] User customized with `AbstractUser` to create the profile with `picture`, `biography`.
-   [x] For the design of templates I use [startbootstrap-sb-admin](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-sb-admin)
-   [x] It starts with the _login page_ using the _email_ and _password_ to start session.

TODO

-   [ ] Configure `settings` for production
-   [ ] Dockerize

:construction: This is a work in progress. :construction:
